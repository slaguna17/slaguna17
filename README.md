# Hi! I'm Sergio  

Also known as Serj! I am a bolivian 🇧🇴 finishing my degree in Computer Science ("Ingenieria en sistemas" in Spanish) and a gamer 🎮


## 🚀 About Me
I’m a technology enthusiast with experience in programming and databases. I graduated in Systems Engineering from the Universidad Privada Boliviana (UPB). Over the past two years, I worked at Actualisap Consultores Bolivia, where I developed skills in SAP HANA and SAP MSSQL.

My short-term goal is to continue growing as a software engineer, deepening my knowledge and acquiring new skills that will allow me to tackle complex challenges and provide innovative solutions. In the long term, I aspire to become a recognized expert in the technology field, specializing in key areas such as systems architecture or artificial intelligence.

I’m always looking for opportunities to learn and collaborate on challenging projects that drive both my professional development and the growth of the teams I work with. If you have an interesting proposal or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
